1. Error: Pod Eviction Due to Resource Constraints

Description: Pods may be evicted due to insufficient resources like CPU or memory.
Remediation: Scale resources accordingly, set resource limits and requests, optimize application efficiency, and consider horizontal pod autoscaling.

2. Error: CrashLoopBackOff

Description: A pod enters a continuous crash and restart loop.
Remediation: Examine pod logs, fix application code or configuration issues, ensure required dependencies are available, and use readiness and liveness probes.

3. Error: ImagePullBackOff

Description: Kubernetes is unable to pull the specified container image.
Remediation: Verify image availability, repository credentials, image name, and version. Check the network connectivity and image pull policy.

4. Error: Unauthorized or Forbidden Access

Description: Users or services are denied access to Kubernetes resources.
Remediation: Check RBAC rules, user roles, service account permissions, and cluster roles. Authenticate with the correct credentials.

5. Error: Services Not Discoverable

Description: Services can’t be accessed within the cluster or externally.
Remediation: Validate service configurations, ports, selectors, and endpoints. Ensure network policies and firewalls allow traffic.

6. Error: Pending Pods

Description: Pods remain in a pending state and don’t start running.
Remediation: Review resource availability, node conditions, and scheduling constraints. Check if there are nodes with sufficient resources.

7. Error: Persistent Volume Issues

Description: Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) fail or don’t bind to available volumes.
Remediation: Verify PVC and PV configurations, storage class availability, and node volume mounts. Troubleshoot storage provider connectivity.

8. Error: Ingress Not Working

Description: Ingress resources are misconfigured, causing external access issues.
Remediation: Review Ingress controller settings, host and path configurations, and DNS resolution. Check for potential TLS certificate problems.

9. Error: Node Unreachable

Description: Nodes become unreachable or are marked as “NotReady.”
Remediation: Investigate network connectivity, node health, firewall rules, and potential node failures. Monitor system logs and node status.

10. Error: Out of Resource Quota

Description: The Kubernetes cluster exceeds allocated resource quotas.
Remediation: Set appropriate resource quotas for namespaces, monitor cluster resource utilization, optimize resource usage, and consider vertical pod autoscaling.
